# what is this

peste2048 - a 2048 game in python that wants to be minimalistic

# why

i want to train an AI for this game because I want to learn about AI
also as i am going through burn-out and starting ADHD meds soon i want
to jog my brain a little to get used to it again.

# license

wtfpl it is because all hail Sam Hocevar.
